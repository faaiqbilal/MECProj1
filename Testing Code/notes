Leaving out plmn info because it does not really give us anything.

PS: the files in the models folder are very useful at getting functions for stuff
The objects returned are not Json or anything, but python classes. 
They have getters and setters in their class files (models) that can be used for info.

see the getters with the @property decorator. calling will return the given property/object

Layer 2 measurements do not appear to provide any useful information that can be used to create features

S1 bearer info stuff has not been implemented in the API yet.

Delete subscription func does not return a response.

The id is incremented every time a subscription is requested, so we need a system to work with the callback reference instead.
