✔ Separate every element for one quantity, save in different variables @done(21-07-18 06:39)
✔ Add this code to a generalized script @done(21-07-27 08:56) Previous code has been merged, subscription work is yet to be added
✘ Find out time interval between updates on the server side @cancelled(21-08-05 05:20) Not necessary anymore
☐ Convert the dc_script.py file to use threading to avoid delays, and make it repeat sending requests
✘ In this new script, run everything in separate threads @cancelled(21-07-27 06:27) I am not sure if this will be necessary, I will probably have to run separate requests in separate threads
☐ Set up and install location api and wlan api
✔ Meet to discuss how to make features out of all this info that has been extracted @done(21-08-05 05:20) (was done earlier, forgot to update)


IMMEDIATE TASKS
☐ Test whether the created lists are showing proper content
☐ Add to larger main script 
☐ Send query for all the terms which need clarification 
✔ Repeat the process for layer 2 measurements @done(21-07-27 06:25) Finding: layer 2 measurements don't really provide anything useful
✔ S1 bearer info findings @done(21-07-27 06:26) Not implemented yet, so can't get that info
☐ probably need to host a server for callback reference problem, will try to get hosting instead of having to host locally
✔ Make query for above problem (for self hosting, or direct IP address use) on stackoverflow @done(21-08-06 15:08)
☐ suggested solution is port forwarding to be set up on the router, will need to see this
☐ Can also try something like noip client
☐ Find out why layer 2 measurements come up empty - they are very important to us

CURRENT STATUS:
    Working on getting subscriptions working
    The callback reference issue needs to be resolved
    I don't understand how to route the communication back to my computer without providing an IP address
    and a port to listen to
    I was hoping that this would be a part of the API and would not need to be implemented separately

PS: 
    Most stuff/findings are being added to the notes.txt if I can't make tasks out of them, the todo helps keeping track of stuff that
    needs to be completed
