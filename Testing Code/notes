Leaving out plmn info because it does not really give us anything.

PS: the files in the models folder are very useful at getting functions for stuff

They have getters and setters in their class files (models) that can be used for info.

see the getters with the @property decorator. calling will return the given property/object

questions to ask:

Findings:

The MEC sandbox is currently only using qci values of 80. Source MEC wiki
Hence qci values should NOT be used towards feature designing.

Layer 2 measurements do not appear to provide any useful information that can be used to create features

S1 bearer info stuff has not been implemented in the API yet.

Delete subscription func does not return a response.

The id is incremented every time a subscription is requested, so we need a system to work with the callback reference instead.

The cell change subscription only appears to work for 4G cells
The RAB Establishment method and the RAB release method also only work with 4G networks
Details for each method can be found here: https://mecwiki.etsi.org/index.php?title=MEC_Sandbox_Help#MEC012_-_Radio_Network_Information_Service_.28RNIS.29

The Cell Change notification does not appear to be too important anyway. It does not return any 
useful information, only informs when a cell tower has been changed
