Leaving out plmn info because it does not really give us anything.

PS: the files in the models folder are very useful at getting functions for stuff
The objects returned are not Json or anything, but python classes. 
They have getters and setters in their class files (models) that can be used for info.

see the getters with the @property decorator. calling will return the given property/object
